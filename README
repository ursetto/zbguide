This is my attempt to work through the examples in the ZeroMQ zguide
using the zmq egg in Chicken.  All code is MIT-licensed.

This repository is not forked from the official zguide repository.
It could become the basis for an official Chicken translation of
zguide, but for now, the intent is to help improve the zmq egg
and make sure we can actually implement all the examples.
